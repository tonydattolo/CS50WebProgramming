    the side plays on the theme of duality. no one person is their
    public facing scrubbed persona, the same way they are not the opposite of the spectrum either.
    we all fall somewhere in the middle, somewhere between bliss and truth, perception and reality.
    I think of myself as many things, yet I could paint a perception of myself to the public sphere,
    that could be anything I want, a blissful lie or a truthful portrayal.
    As is the nature of human beings, to evolve, so have I. Thus, I am many things.
    Artist and engineer. Student and teacher. Leader and follower. People are not discrete,
    but an infinite spectrum that constantly changes.
    The site is equal parts critique and satire, on the oxymoronic quest to be both professional
    and to be yourself. To be concerned with such things is important in a business sense. You want
    your customers to know who your brand is, and what it stands for, and to be consist with your
    overarching strategy to deliver value to the world. However, for individuals, this is a 
    point of creative destruction. It is an attempt to fit into a box, something so dynamic,
    no set of words can wholy reveal it's nature or intention.
