# My Project
For this project, I have chosen a personal website. I think it's a relatively simple thing to tackle, with clearly defined topics to incorporate. There's also room for expansion with a blog to show case writing, or to show prospective recruiters or followers what my passions are, who I am, and some of the things I've done.
